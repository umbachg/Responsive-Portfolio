                    Hi my name is Gabbi. I'm from Michigan but born in Oklahoma. This is my first time studying anything
                    related
                    to coding. I came down to Kansas in order to attend University of Kansas in Lawrence. I double
                    majored
                    in
                    Visual Arts with a concentration in jewelry/metalsmithing and Korean Language and Culture Studies. I
                    studied
                    there for two years before reevaluating my values and career goals and realised that it wasn't a
                    great
                    fit
                    for me since I enjoy eating and being financially stable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My downtime generally involves my boyfriend and I taking our dog to state parks in Missouri and
                    Arkansas
                    for
                    hiking and swimming. When I have the time I enjoy drawing, painting and sculpting.
                </p>
